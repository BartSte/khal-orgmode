* Introduction
  `khal-orgmode` is a commandline tool that converts agenda items of org-mode
  into khal calendar items.  

** Definitions
   - org -> org mode [[https://orgmode.org]]
   - CalDav -> internet standard for client access to calendars [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV]]
   - vdirsyncer -> command line tool for synchronizing calendars [[https://github.com/pimutils/vdirsyncer]]
   - khal -> command line calendar app [[https://github.com/pimutils/khal]]
   - Davmail -> CalDav exchange gateway [[https://davmail.sourceforge.net/e]]

** Motivation
   I use org to manage my agenda and my notes. However, in a professional
   setting, you are often required to use proprietary software for your agenda, 
   like Office 365. Luckly, the CalDav standard exists which allows for
   synchronization between agendas from different suppliers.

   Personally, I wanted have the following setup: 
   #+begin_example
    ┌───┐      
    │Org│      
    └┬──┘      
    ┌▽──┐      
    │???│      
    └┬──┘      
    ┌▽────────┐
    │Office365│
    └─────────┘
   #+end_example

** Installation

** Requirements
*** Functional
    - [-] Import vdirsyncer calendar into org.   
      It is possible to import calendar items from vdirsyncer into org. It must
      be imported as a plain time stamp.
    - [-] Export a new org agenda item to vdirsyncer.  
      Org's export functionality is used to export a single org item to a
      vdirsyncer calendar. A heading and a plain timestamp are required for
      this export.
    - [ ] Edit an existing calendar item in vdirsyncer from org.  
      Imported org agenda items can be edited and exported so that the
      vdirsyncer items are updated instead of duplicated.              
    - [ ] Recurring items           
    - [ ] Import/Export ~SCHEDULED~ timestamps                
    - [ ] Import/Export ~DEADLINE~  timestamps                
    - [ ] Timezones
