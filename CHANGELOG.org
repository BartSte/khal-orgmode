    be activated temporarly.

    ~+1w~,  ~+1m~, and  ~+1y~ are supported for now.
  - Added OrgDateAgenda, which applies RRULE information to the timestamps and
    groups them together within 1 org agenda item.
  - Added OrgAgenda which is a collection of OrgAgendaItems. OrgAgenda objects
    accept a format file that can be found in the static folder of the source
    (`khalorg_format.txt`). If the user creates it in
    ~$HOME/.config/khalorg/khalorg_format.txt~ the user can specify a personal
    formatting file.
